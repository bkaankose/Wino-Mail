# 🚀 Welcome to Wino Mail 1.7.6

This version brings bunch of UI improvements and bugfixes on top of the added features thanks to our community members.

## Separated UI Zones

Community liked the proposed designs for separated UI parts and it's implemented now thanks to [Tiktack](https://github.com/Tiktack)

## Including Conversation History for Replies and Forwards

Previously when you replied to an e-mail conversation history was not included into new draft. This was a limitation due to Quill editor we use as a composer editor but now thanks to [Tiktack](https://github.com/Tiktack) Wino now uses Jodit editor as a composer. It's able to render HTML as it is better.

## HTML Signatures

You can now copy your signature as HTML and paste directly into signature editor. This was asked by community and now is possible with the new Jodit composer.

## Reworked Menu System

Merged accounts will not list individual accounts below instead of inside the More folder menu item.

## New IMAP and Gmail Folder Synchronization

IMAP and Gmail folder synchronization mechanism is reworked. New code works faster and fixed couple parent-child relation issues with the folder. I hope this will also resolve a lot of people complaining some Gmail folders are not visible for them after the initial sync.

## New Languages

Thanks to our amazing community members Wino has more languages supported in this version with the help of Crowdin contributors.

Some of the translations are not completed yet, and Wino will fallback to English strings in case of the translation has not been translated yet.
