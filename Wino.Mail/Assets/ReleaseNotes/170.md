# 🚀 Welcome to Wino Mail

Over the last 5 months I've been working on a huge patch to improve Wino. It's finally here! Lots of good stuff baked into this update with the help of new contributors... Yes, with the help of new contributors because;

## 🍀 Wino is now open source

Source code has been released to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bkaankose/Wino-Mail/). Previously this was an issue only repository to track issues. Now you have access to the source code. Please check out the  [Contribution guideline](https://github.com/bkaankose/Wino-Mail/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started before jumping into the code.

#### 😔 Apologies

Due to the new improvements in the database structure to support some of the improvements and new features, your existing account information won't be migrated to this version. You must re-add your accounts. My sincere apologies :/

## 📧 Linked Inbox 

Another feature from the Mail & Calendar is here. You can merge 2 or more accounts into 1 and check common folders like Inbox, Deleted, Spam etc. together! This was one of the highly requested features so far. Give it a try and let me know!

## New Menu Navigation System

Wino's nested account-folder menu structure was a hussle for lots of people. Users wanted the old single-click navigation system back from the Mail & Calendars. Therefore, it's implemented in Wino as well. Now you are able to change the account first then the folders will load automatically.

In case of linked inbox, you will have a separate nested menu for each account individually, but common folders that serve the same purpose will be displayed as one.

## Extra Settings

More settings are baked into this version.

![Language Time Settings](https://www.winomail.app/images/languageTimeSettings.png)

## Imap Setup Dialog Improvements

Wino has now improved advanced IMAP server setup dialog for those who need more options to connect their IMAP servers. Most of the time Auto settings will work for you, but some servers require additional fields to be configured. Go for it only if you need to.

- Chinese
