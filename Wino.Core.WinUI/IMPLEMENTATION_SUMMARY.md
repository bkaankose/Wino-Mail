   - Extended interface with backdrop management and enhanced accent color support
   - Backward compatible with existing IThemeService functionality

3. **NewThemeService Implementation** (`Wino.Core.WinUI\Services\NewThemeService.cs`)
   - Full WinUI-optimized theme service
   - Window backdrop management with WindowEx support
   - Enhanced accent color management with theme preservation
   - Proper initialization sequence for backdrop application
   - Event system for backdrop, theme, and accent color changes

### üîß Integration Updates

4. **CoreUWPContainerSetup.cs** - Updated DI registration
   - Registers both old and new theme services
   - Maintains backward compatibility

5. **WinoApplication.cs** - Enhanced base application class
   - Added NewThemeService property and initialization  
   - Updated service initialization order
   - Proper backdrop application timing

6. **App.xaml.cs** - Updated application launch sequence
   - Loads backdrop settings before window creation
   - Applies backdrop immediately after window creation
   - Maintains proper initialization flow

7. **ShellWindow.xaml** - Removed hardcoded backdrop
   - Allows NewThemeService to control backdrop dynamically

## Key Features Delivered

### ‚ú® Window Backdrop Management
- **Dynamic Backdrop Control**: Switch between Mica, Acrylic, and other backdrops at runtime
- **Persistent Settings**: Backdrop preferences saved and restored across app sessions
- **Initialization Support**: Backdrop applied before window is shown to user
- **Multiple Backdrop Types**:
  - `Mica` - Standard translucent material
  - `MicaAlt` - Alternative Mica variant
  - `DesktopAcrylic` - Semi-transparent acrylic
  - `AcrylicBase` & `AcrylicThin` - Acrylic variants
  - `None` - No backdrop for solid backgrounds

### üé® Enhanced Accent Color Management
- **Theme-Preserving Color Changes**: Change accent color without switching themes
- **System Integration**: Automatic system accent color detection
- **Improved API**: `SetAccentColorAsync()` with better control options
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing accent color code

### üñºÔ∏è Custom Wallpaper Support
- **Existing Functionality**: Polished implementation from old service
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Automatic preview image creation
- **Persistent Storage**: Themes saved in local app data
- **Metadata Management**: JSON-based theme configuration

### ‚ö° Better Initialization
- **Startup Performance**: Backdrop settings loaded early in app lifecycle
- **Window Creation Flow**: Proper timing between window creation and backdrop application
- **Service Dependencies**: Correct initialization order with other services
- **Configuration Persistence**: All settings properly saved and restored

### üîÑ Backward Compatibility
- **Dual Service Support**: Both old and new services available
- **Gradual Migration**: Can migrate features incrementally
- **API Compatibility**: All existing theme functionality preserved
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing code continues to work

## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Registration Pattern
```csharp
// Both services registered for compatibility
services.AddSingleton<IThemeService, ThemeService>();
services.AddSingleton<INewThemeService, NewThemeService>();
```

### Initialization Sequence
1. App constructs services (including NewThemeService)
2. OnLaunched loads saved backdrop type from configuration
3. Window is created (ShellWindow)
4. Backdrop is applied immediately via ApplyBackdropAsync()
5. Service initialization completes (InitializeServicesAsync)
6. Window is activated and shown to user

### Configuration Keys
- `WindowBackdropTypeKey`: Backdrop type preference
- `AccentColorKey`: Custom accent color
- `CurrentApplicationThemeKey`: Selected theme ID
- `SelectedAppThemeKey`: Element theme (Light/Dark/Default)

### Event System
- `BackdropChanged`: Fired when backdrop type changes
- `ElementThemeChanged`: Existing theme change events
- `AccentColorChanged`: Existing accent color events

## Benefits Over Original ThemeService

### üéØ WinUI Optimized
- **WindowEx Integration**: Proper SystemBackdrop property usage
- **Modern Backdrop Types**: Support for latest WinUI backdrop materials
- **Performance**: Optimized for WinUI rendering pipeline

### üí° Enhanced User Experience  
- **Visual Polish**: Professional backdrop effects (Mica, Acrylic)
- **Smooth Transitions**: Proper backdrop switching without flicker
- **System Integration**: Respects system theme and accent preferences

### üîß Developer Experience
- **Better APIs**: Async methods with proper error handling
- **Event System**: Rich event notifications for UI updates
- **Clear Separation**: Theme vs backdrop vs accent color management
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

### üöÄ Future Ready
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new backdrop types
- **Modern Patterns**: Async/await, proper DI integration
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Testable**: Interface-based design with dependency injection

## Deployment Notes

### Required Steps for Integration
1. ‚úÖ All code files created and properly structured
2. ‚úÖ Service registration updated in DI container
3. ‚úÖ WinoApplication updated with NewThemeService support
4. ‚úÖ App launch sequence updated for proper backdrop initialization
5. ‚úÖ Hardcoded backdrop removed from XAML
6. ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained
7. ‚úÖ Documentation and examples provided

### Testing Recommendations
- Test all backdrop types on different system themes
- Verify backdrop persistence across app restarts  
- Test accent color changes with different themes
- Verify custom theme creation still works
- Test on different Windows versions and hardware

### Migration Path
- Services can coexist during transition period
- Teams can migrate features incrementally
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Full backward compatibility maintained

This implementation provides a solid foundation for modern WinUI theming with professional backdrop effects while maintaining all existing functionality.
