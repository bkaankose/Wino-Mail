## Motivation

I'm a big fan of Windows Mail & Calendars due to its simplicity. Personally, I find it more intuitive for daily use cases compared to Outlook desktop and the new WebView2 powered Outlook version. Seeing [Microsoft deprecating it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/outlook-for-windows-the-future-of-mail-calendar-and-people-on-windows-11-715fc27c-e0f4-4652-9174-47faa751b199#:~:text=The%20Mail%20and%20Calendar%20applications,will%20no%20longer%20be%20supported.) dragged me into starting to work on Wino a couple of years ago. Wino's main motivation is to bring all the existing functionality from Mail & Calendars over time without changing the user experience that millions have loved since the Windows 8 days in Mail & Calendars
